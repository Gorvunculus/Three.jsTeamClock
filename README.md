# Three.jsTeamClock

We decided to create a sort of small abstrct museum. It features two imported OBJ objects and one imprted GLTF object, textured with different materials. They cast shadows onto their stands, and rotate to show off the shadow effect. There are WASD controls to move around the scene with, which can be unlocked by pressing esc.
